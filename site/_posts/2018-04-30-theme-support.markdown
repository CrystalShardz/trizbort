Trizbort.io now supports themes. Not only can you set fills, borders, text colors for rooms, notes and blocks, set colors for connector lines and text, but you can also apply a complete set of colors and settings in one go (a theme). At this point, we have the "default" theme - it's the default, as you might have guessed - and the obsidian theme, which is a cool name for really dark.

All color settings get saved along with your map, and they're also imported from Trizbort desktop.
