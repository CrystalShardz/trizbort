A good test case for Trizbort.io is drawing up a map of Zork. The original map contains lots of ideosyncracies for map drawing: angled connections, (nested) objects in the rooms, one-way passages, connectors that lead off the map, and a shaded block around the White House.  

![Original Zork map]({{ "/assets/zork-map-original.jpg" | absolute_url }})

This map was drawn with Trizbort.io:

![Zork map in Trizbort.io]({{ "/assets/zork-map-trizbort.jpg" | absolute_url }})

And here is the result of the TADS code generation:

{% highlight c %}
#charset "us-ascii"

#include <adv3.h>
#include <en_us.h>
