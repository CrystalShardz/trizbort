## Code generation

* ADL
* Adrift
* Alan 2
* Alan 3
* Heritage ? (requires only rooms in cardinal directions on a grid)
* Hugo
* Inform7
* Gamefic (Ruby)
* Quest
* TADS
* TextAdventure.js   (https://github.com/TheBroox/TextAdventure.js)

Code generations may allow selection of options; chosen options have default 
values and changes are saved in local storage. For instance, TADS may allow exporting
everything to a single file or every room into its own file, where the result is offered
as a ZIP.

### Quest export
- [ ] export of up/down direction
- [ ] export of grid_width and grid_length for the room
- [ ] export of grid_length for the exit 
- [ ] export of gridborder path
- [ ] export of room label
